## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Scope Guard

This command's own work is limited to updating the project constitution itself. Dependent templates
and commands read the constitution at runtime and are not modified here.

- Classify every part of the user input as either constitution content or a separate,
  non-governance intent.
- If the input includes feature implementation, code generation, refactoring, building, or
  deployment requests, you **MUST NOT** execute them. Extract them as deferred intents instead.
- You **MUST NOT** create, modify, or delete application source files, feature routes,
  components, tests, deployment files, or other artifacts unrelated to the constitution
  workflow.
- If it is unclear whether an instruction is constitution content, ask for clarification before
  making changes.
- After completing the constitution update, include a `Next Actions` section for each deferred
  intent. List the original intent and suggest the appropriate follow-up, such as the
  `issue-spec` skill or `/speckit-plan`, without invoking it.
- If there are no non-governance intents, omit the `Next Actions` section.

## Outline

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. The scaffold is
`.specify/templates/constitution-template.md`, read directly.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Read [`.specify/templates/constitution-template.md`](../../../.specify/templates/constitution-template.md) as the active template. Run no script for this.
   - If `.specify/memory/constitution.md` exists, load it as the source of current project-specific
     values and amendments. Preserve information that is still applicable when applying the newly
     resolved scaffold.
   - If it does not exist, use the template as the initial document.
   - Do not write back to the template.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise derive a candidate from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded) and present it to the user for ratification. A constitution is governance: never write an inferred principle as if it had been adopted.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content using the template as the required structure:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Produce a Sync Impact Report as an HTML comment at the top of the constitution file after update.
   This report is temporary scratch material for human review of the amendment, not governance
   content; it is expected to be removed before the amended constitution file is committed.
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

5. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

6. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

7. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any TODO placeholders or deferred items requiring manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).
   - A `Next Actions` section for any deferred non-governance intents.

Formatting & Style Requirements:

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing, insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Write only `.specify/memory/constitution.md`; do not create or modify template source files.
